# ReactJS Image Gallery

##### Refactoring the entire app in the [next-version branch](https://github.com/NazimHAli/react-image-gallery/tree/next-version). Replaced Webpack with vitejs and using vanilla styling, components instead of a component library.

ReactJS + [imgur API](https://imgur.com/) built with WebPack 5 in TypeScript. Using a few components and styling from [material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) for the first iteration.

##### Mocked Data From API
If you don't want to register and use the free imgur API, it will use mocked data/saved responses from the API. It's also useful for faster local development so you don't have to make new requests with every HMR update.

##### Bundle
The bundle size is 347K, larger than anticipated. Even after implementing [mui best practices](https://mui.com/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/) like lazy-loading, code splitting...etc. After analyzing the bundle, realized that the standard React package has increased in size.
