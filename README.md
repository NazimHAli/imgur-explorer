# ReactJS Imgur

ReactJS + [imgur](https://imgur.com/) built with WebPack 5 in TypeScript. Using a few components and styling from [material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) for the first iteration. The bundle size is much larger than anticipated. Even after implementing [mui best practices](https://mui.com/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/) like lazy-loading, code splitting...etc the total bundle size is 2.2MBs.
